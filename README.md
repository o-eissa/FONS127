# Hi, I'm Omar Eissa and Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

👋 Hi there! I'm a passionate software engineer. On this page, you'll find some of the sample code and drafts that I've been working on recently, as well my working projects and packages.

## What you'll find here

- 🤖 **Sample code:** You'll find some examples of the code I've been working on recently. These are mostly just experiments and prototypes, but I hope you find them interesting!
- 🎨 **Fun projects:** In addition to the code samples, I like to work on some fun projects that let me flex my creative muscles. Expect to find some silly, whimsical, and just plain weird stuff here!
- 📦 **Working projects and packages:** I also have a few working projects and packages that I've created and maintain. Like [Coast Guard Search](https://github.com/o-eissa/CoastGuard-Search-Project), [OneDrive client for Go](https://github.com/o-eissa/Onedrive), [Matrix Grid Search](https://github.com/o-eissa/Matrix-Ai-Agent), [GoModJavaParser](https://github.com/o-eissa/GoModJavaParser).
- 🌍 **Open source contributions:** Some forked open source repos I've been contributing to. Ex: [Alvarium-Java](https://github.com/project-alvarium/alvarium-sdk-java), [Alvarium-Go](https://github.com/project-alvarium/alvarium-sdk-go).
